how can go back in time with commits ? 
git checkout commitID (detached head with no branch ) 
git branch -b f1 (add a branch to the detached head) 



git reset HEAD~1 (remove -1 commit and untstage changes ) 
git reset --soft HEAD~1 (remove -1 commit but with changes staged ) 
git reset --hard HEAD~1 (remove -1 commit completly )



if we have the same commits base => created new branch f1 => added commits => want to merge with master => fast forward 


if we have different commits base => created new branch f1 => added commits => added commits to the master branch => want to merge  master and f1  => recursive merge
